<h1>The Best Movies According to Botija</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Dune 2</h3>
<p>
  I really love both the first and second Dune but the second is just so
  thrilling and well written.
</p>
<h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
<p>
  This was a favorite of mind from a young age. I love the music in the film the
  most.
</p>
<h3>Return of Jedi</h3>
<p>
  I absolutely love science fiction films and this is one of the first that I
  ever watched.
